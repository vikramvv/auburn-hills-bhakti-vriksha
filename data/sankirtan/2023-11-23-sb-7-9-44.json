  "english_translation": "My dear Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, I see that there are many saintly persons indeed, but they are interested only in their own deliverance. Not caring for the big cities and towns, they go to the Himālayas or the forest to meditate with vows of silence [mauna-vrata]. They are not interested in delivering others. As for me, however, I do not wish to be liberated alone, leaving aside all these poor fools and rascals. I know that without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, without taking shelter of Your lotus feet, one cannot be happy. Therefore I wish to bring them back to shelter at Your lotus feet.",

      "details": "Engaging in Krishna's service, especially book distribution (sankirtana), provides profound spiritual protection. A Krishna conscious person can remain happy even in 'hellish' places like shopping malls, because their consciousness is fixed on the Lord. Prabhupada assures that one cannot be contaminated on sankirtana if they follow basic regulative principles, being situated 'transiently' in the spiritual world even while physically in the material one.",

      "details": "Krishna declares that one who preaches the message of Bhagavad-gita to His devotees is most dear to Him, and no one can excel him in satisfying the Lord. Spreading Krishna consciousness is the supreme welfare activity because it addresses the root cause of suffering—lack of spiritual awareness—unlike temporary material relief efforts. Pleasing Krishna by engaging in this service is the ultimate goal of life, as it guarantees everything else.",

This involves engaging in service to Guru and Krishna regardless of one's fluctuating physical or psychological conditions, recognizing these as material. The DUTY acronym (Desire, Unqualified, Tool, Your Holy Name) summarizes the mood of surrender and faith required.",

Doubts about distributing to non-believers who might disrespect books are addressed by Prabhupada's instruction to 'flood the planet with books,' as even minimal contact can transform a soul (e.g., finding a book in the trash). The speaker also shares an anecdote of a 'Pingala moment' where surrendering to Krishna's will led to renewed enthusiasm and successful distribution.",

One's 'busyness' is often a choice, and there are countless ways to integrate Krishna consciousness (like listening to audiobooks during daily tasks). The concept of a 'stretch zone' encourages consistent, moderate effort to avoid both laxity and burnout, leading to sustainable spiritual growth. Condensing sadhana involves infusing every moment with Krishna's remembrance.",

      "question": "How to keep the mood of distributing books intact continuously, especially if not doing it daily?",
      "answer": "To maintain the mood, one must constantly increase their understanding of what these books are about, which comes from reading them daily. Prabhupada said that if we are not taking up this mission of sharing, we haven't understood it. Reading Bhagavatam helps understand the urgency, as every sentence implicitly asks to be distributed. Chanting attentively also helps. Make a point of distributing at least one book (even a small pamphlet) daily to 'stay in the fire.' If the urgency wanes, it means one needs to read Prabhupada's books more.",

      "answer": "Intelligent distribution means making the best use of energy. There are no hard and fast rules; sometimes giving a whole stack for free to an interested person is better than pushing one book on someone who will throw it away. The goal is that books are covered and BBT debt is managed. As for approach, distribute in a way that makes you want to distribute again tomorrow. Find your 'stretch zone' where you are challenged but not overwhelmed. Whether that's passive or aggressive, if it's productive for you and sustainable, it's okay. If nothing is happening from being passive, try a more aggressive approach. If being too aggressive is draining or ineffective, find a middle ground. The main thing is to find your comfortable and productive zone.",
      "category": "practice"
    },
    {
      "question": "What about giving books to non-believers who might not respect them or even throw them away?",
      "answer": "Prabhupada's instruction was to 'flood the planet with books,' even in wartime. There are countless stories of people finding books in trash cans and becoming devotees (e.g., Nandakirtan Prabhu). Even if someone throws it away (like the speaker did with his first Gita), that initial contact can be the beginning of their Krishna consciousness. While one shouldn't force books on people to the point of anger, giving them a chance is crucial. Any contact with the book is beneficial, even if they just walk by and appreciate the distributor, they are guaranteed a human birth.",

      "answer": "Realistically, we are as busy as we want to be. There is always time if one makes it. You can listen to audiobooks of Prabhupada's works while driving, showering, or before bed. Even short bursts of reading (one minute here, five minutes there) add up. If you find your urgency waning or consciousness getting disturbed, it's a clear sign you need to read more. Reading Prabhupada's books is like taking a 'pill' for the spiritual disease. Life is short, so utilize intelligence to make time for spiritual growth. Condense your sadhana by infusing every daily activity with Krishna consciousness; for example, chanting during mundane tasks. When Krishna (time) is added to your life, you have unlimited time.",

      "answer": "Part of your service as a householder is raising Krishna conscious children. It's not about neglecting everything else for book distribution; it's about finding a balance and not feeling guilty. Consider the 'big picture': if you can raise your child to become a book distributor, that's a huge service. Prabhupada didn't only distribute books himself; he engaged his disciples. It's a 'cultural conquest' where many services contribute. Don't be fanatical to the point of neglecting other duties, but if you have to lean one way, lean towards spiritual effort, as we tend to be too lax. Put everything in its proper perspective.",

However, the late Prahlad Nṛsiṁha Prabhu, a prolific distributor, attributed his success to distributing only Prabhupada's books, citing Prabhupada's particular desire for certain books (especially hardbacks) to be distributed, as they guarantee one becomes Krishna conscious. Ultimately, it's about being true to oneself and what works best, but Prabhupada's specific instructions should be given great weight.",
